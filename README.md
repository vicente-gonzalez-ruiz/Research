## Biography

Vicente González-Ruiz is associate professor in the Informatics
Department of the University of Almería. He received an M.Sc. degree
in computer science from the University of Granada in 1992, and a
Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Almería
in 2000. He is a member of
the
[Supercomputing-Algorithms Research Group](https://www.hpca.ual.es/)
of the University of Almería.

## Research career 

My research focuses on image and video encoding, as well as their
transmission over data networks based on packet switching.
Initially I worked on progressive image coding algorithms
(mainly based on SPIHT (Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees)) which were
applied in electron microscopy images, in collaboration with CNB (Cento Nacional de Biotecnología)
scientists of the CSIC (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas), with the purpose of
remotely managing a electronic microscope. These encoding algorithms were also applied to
astronomical images generated at the Calar Alto Hispano-German Astronomical Center
in Almería, also with the aim of improving remote observation processes.

Subsequently, I have applied the JPEG2000 image compression standard in environments
interactive transmission of images. In connection with this, in 2010 I participated in the
development of a JPIP (JPEG2000 Interactive Protocol) server that ESA (European
Space Agency) has used in its project [JHelioviewer](https://www.jhelioviewer.org/).
In this line of work, I have continued to collaborate with ESA for the
development of algorithms of streaming JPEG2000 image sequences.

I have also collaborated in studies of compression of hyperspectral images of the Earth.
In the field of video encoding, my work has focused on improving the rate of
compression of the Motion JPEG2000 standard using MCTF (Motion Compensated Temporal
Filtering). We develop an extension compatible with the standard that does not imply altering the
JPIP servers. Also related to this field, I have worked on algorithms of
JPIP-based streams that use conditional refresh and do not involve modifying Motion JPEG2000 code-streams.
These techniques have application to interactive transmission of images.

Currently I am working in the processing of electron microscopy images, and in the
development of symmetric video codecs.

In a field somewhat more related to the development of free software, I have contributed to the
development of a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) communications protocol called [P2PSP](http://www.p2psp.org)
(P2P Straightforward Protocol). This protocol allows emulating the
behavior of IP (Internet Protocol) Multicast, achieving a streaming system
efficient, secure and scalable. P2PSP was developed with funds from the Google program
Summer of Code during the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.
